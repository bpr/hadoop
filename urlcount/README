A simple url counting program (counts each occurrence of a URL in a dataset) in OCaml to be run 
under the streaming interface of hadoop. Make sure OCaml PCRE library is up to date on all nodes. 

To test this on Unix sans hadoop, try 

./mapper < testfile | sort | ./reducer

A bash script 'urlcount' is included to show how to set the arguments to 
hadoop.
